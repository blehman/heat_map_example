#Color Transformation Heatmap
Inspired by [tjdecke's block](http://bl.ocks.org/tjdecke/5558084), a few
color transition were added to the cells along with a variation in text
color to make significant values standout. 

Topic modeling provided the clusters in the columns. A filter was
applied to the dataset to produce row counts. Chi-squared normalization provided the relative scores.
